# Drawing Tablet Software: Semester Project in Programming Fundamentals (1st Semester)

For my first-semester project in "Programming Fundamentals Course," I developed a basic drawing tablet software. This software functions as a digital sketchpad, allowing users to draw using various commands and options.

## Key Features

1. **Drawing Commands:** Users can move the drawing pointer forward, backward, right, left, and rotate it in any direction to create their drawings.

2. **Color Options:** Choose from ten different colors to make drawings vibrant and colorful.

3. **Shape Options:** Draw various shapes, including squares, rectangles and circles. Users can adjust the size, position and color/width of them as well.

4. **Pen Up/Pen Down:** Control whether the pointer is drawing lines or not, enabling the creation of detailed designs.

5. **Pointer Width Adjustment:** Change the thickness of the lines drawn on the canvas to add depth to drawings.

## Technical Details

1. **Programming Language:** The software was developed entirely in C++.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The GUI of the project is very basic, requiring users to type all commands in order to run.

3. **Drawing Functions:** The provided function templates were modified and implemented for drawing lines, circles, etc., on the canvas.

4. **Error Handling:** The software is equipped with error handling to manage mistakes in user input and provide clear messages to guide users.

## Issues Faced

- **Repeat Command Issue:** The repeat command functionality was not working properly despite efforts to troubleshoot and implement it correctly.
  
## Conclusion

This project was my first attempt at software development and showcases my understanding of programming fundamentals. Although there were challenges, the software provides a creative way for users to express themselves digitally through drawing. Additionally, the software records the history of all commands entered, enhancing user experience and providing a useful feature for reviewing past actions.
